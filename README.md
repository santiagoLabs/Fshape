# Fshape - Dinosaur Collection
Face detection and censorship software developed in Java and OpenCV.
Back in June 2016 when i just wanted to play with computer vision and had just learnt Java in Highschool.


# Fshape is part of the Dinosaur Collection. 
# The Dinosaur Collection is composed by projects built at the beginning of my programming adventure.
